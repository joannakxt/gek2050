                <h3><center>Introduction</center></h3>
                <br>
                <p>William Shakespeare is a famous playwright who has written a lot of plays and well-known as an author in English literature. He has written 38 plays, 145 sonnets and 2 poems that gave a new meaning to the English language where people from all over the world started to study his works. His works generally fall under three categories namely, Comedies, Tragedies and Histories even though there may be some overlaps in these genres. <br><br>
                    
                In this project, I will be focusing on Shakespearen Tragedy where there are several distinct features that allows it to be identified as such. They are mainly: characters becoming isolated, having a death ending, premonition that an occurence is inevitable and having a main character who is noble but lacking in some sense, leading to eventual downfall (Allie, 2016). Such plays include Titus Andronicus, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Hamlet and more. Among these, Romeo and Juliet will be further analysed and discussed.<br><br>
                
                As Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, it is likely to suggest that the words used in the text will largely have negative connatations or emotional tones. Hence, this project aims to analyse if the emotional tones used in the original Shakespare's text is preserved and relatively maintained in its various adaption over the years. The adaptions that are used to analysed against the original text are as shown.

                <h3><center>Description of Analysis</center></h3>
                <br>
                <p>There are a lot of analysis tools developed for the Digital Humanities and one of them is CATMA (Computer Assisted Textual Markup and Analysis), which will be used in this project mainly for its analysis and manual annotation features. By using the manual annotation feature, a tagset called "emotional tones" is created consisting of two main emotion tags: joy and sadness. With this tagset, any words or phrases in the text that is applicable to the emotion will be tagged accordingly. A snippet of the tagged emotion words is shown in the figure below where the left column shows the phrases tagged as sadness and the right column as joy.
                After doing so, the analysis feature allows for visualistion of the results through a graph with the general trend and frequency of each tags.<br><br>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <a class='anchor' id='results'></a>                
                <h3><center>Results from Analysis</center></h3>
                <br>
                As the original play centers around negative emotions, we will first analyse the emotional tone- sadness. 
                It can be seen that none of the adaptions tend to follow the general trend of the original play as the distinct peaks are arising at different timings. Towards the end, the original play has a sharp spike which is in contrast to West Side Story with only a subtle increase and Gnomeo and Juliet having a decrease instead. 
                <br><br>
                This may be attributed by the fact that the adaptions do not want to portray death as the only way that two person can be together and hence, incorporated their style of directing in order to reach out to their targetted masses. Jam Filled Toronto, the studio that directed Gnomeo and Juliet, produced many films for children whereby their characters are usually portrayed as lively and adventurous and hence, a sad ending with tragic deaths might traumatise the children instead. 
                
                <p><center><u>Emotion - Sadness</u></center> </p>
                <center><img src="img/final-sadness.png" alt="" style="width:554px;height:878px;"></center>
                <br><br>
                For the emotional tone - joy, there seems to be more similarities in the general trend of both adaptions when compared with the original as shown in the graphs below. Even though it is apparent that in Romeo and Juliet, the ending has completely no joy as seen in the dip towards the end, it is not so for the other adaptions as there is a surprisingly increase in the frequency of the emotion word instead. This further illustrates that adaptions may be trying to break out of the tragic ending and injecting more elements of happiness to better capture their audience.
                <p><center><u>Emotion - Joy</u></center> </p>
                <center><img src="img/final-joy.png" alt="" style="width:554px;height:878px;"></center>
                <br><br>
            

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <a class="anchor" id='conclusion'></a>
                <h3><center>Conclusion</center></h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                With the analysis above, it can be seen that the adaptions are adjusted to suit the audiences. The mismatch in the general trend as well as the frequency of the emotion words have surfaced as a result of trying to preserve the idea of the original play while ensuring that it is still relatable. The results from this analysis help to further substantiate the idea behind the the book, "Teaching Shakespeare with Film and Television" by H.R. Coursen as it can be seen from the attempt of the adaptions to engage specific groups so that the story can be told and taught to them more effectively. For instance, with children being the target audience of Gnomeo and Juliet, the plot is adjusted to what they are familiar with and hence, the opposite ending as compared to the original play. Though West Side Story seems to have maintained more of the original's emotional tones better compared to Gnomeo and Juliet, it may be because their target audience are not on the other extreme end of the spectrum. 
                <br><br>
                Through the usage of CATMA for analysis and visualisation, interesting comparison can be done between adaptions where it is able to give a general insight as to how much emotional tones are being preserved through various adaptions over the years. In the two adaptions analysed, the emotional tone - sadness seems to be fading wheres the emotional tone - joy has more emphasis as compared to the original play.
                However, it is important to take into account that the conclusion drawn cannot be a indisputable one as the manual tagging of the emotional tone words is subjective and in some ambiguous case, may differ from person to person. With the inculsion of analysis from other various sentimental tools, the conclusion can become more substantial and significant.
